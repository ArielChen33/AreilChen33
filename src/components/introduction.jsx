            <p>This is Wan Qi Chen, you can call me Ariel as well. 
                I am a graduate student studying information science at University of Pittsburgh now. 
                I have learned a lot in this program such as machine learning, web designing, and algorithm, etc. 
                Connecting the skills from frontend, through backend, to database is an excited adventure to me. 
                Consequently, I am looking for an opportunity to accumulate more practical skills and experience.
