##Assignment 2

#What framework did you pick and why?
Ans:
I used react as the framework in this assignment. Learning from other's experience that vue is really useful, and it won't upgrade so frequently as react, so I wanted to use vue at the beginning. However, when I started modifying other reference codes of vue on Glitch, it had a lot of errors and I had no idea to fix it. As a result, I started to try react since I have heard it frequently no matter the content chatting with people or on the job description. And then I surprisingly found that it worked smoothly on react, and once I have been familiar with the methods, I could complete them efficiently.

#What about that framework appealed to you, for this project?
Ans:
After searching for several introduction about react, I found it could update efficiently by using Virtual DOM. Because I hate waiting for wesites loading for a long time, this feature is definitely a big advantage for me. Besides, another feature of react is it frequently using components. In that case, I could seperate my content to many different parts. When I need to manage, fix bugs, or modify some details, I could quickly find out its location instead of browsing a lot of codes. Futhermore, .jsx is a brand-new file type to me. It is similar to the .html file, using it to describing the content you want to show on the pages. However, it is more easy to understand since it avoid complicated javascript DOM structure. And in react, many things could be realized as .js, that is more easy to manipulate the commands in more relatively simpler way. In conclusion, since the feature of react is concise and more simpler to manage, the reasons are enough for me to select it to do my assignment.

#Describe the site you built for this assignment. What does it do? What components or features of the framework did you explore for this project
Ans:
It is my personal website. In this assignment I show all of the feature on myself. Besides the information that would also showed on my resume, there are also my contact information and my social media information, so that if people have interests on me after reading my information, they could come and contact with me.

To make the space of the whole page more concise and readable, I used a lot of components to mark off different parts appropriately. And in those components, I used not only just text information, like <p>, but also put some links with its representative icons, so that reader could realize the meaning more quickly without feeling bored since there are too much words. And on the top of page, there are clickable button on the navigate bar. If readers only want to know some specific information, they can just click on the title, and than the page would go to the content directly.
